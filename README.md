# Data and code for: Epiphytes as pollution biomonitor
Evaluation of vascular and non vascular epiphytes as biomonitors

## Description
This repository contains the datasets and R scripts used in the analyses presented in the manuscript:

> Carmona-Higuita, M.J., García-Arias, M., Duque-Trujillo, J.F., Benavides, A.M., 2025. Epiphytes as effective biomonitors of urban air pollution in a tropical city (Medellín, Colombia). *Science of the Total Environment* (submitted).

The study evaluates the potential of vascular and non-vascular epiphytes (bryophytes, lichens, and vascular species such as *Tillandsia recurvata*, *Pleopeltis macrocarpa*, and *Rhipsalis baccifera*) as biomonitors of atmospheric pollution in Medellín, Colombia. Analyses include magnetic susceptibility (χ), elemental composition, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations.
